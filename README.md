# customer-registration
Program used to test out my understanding on Python basics including dictonaries, inputs, if loops, etc.

Project Overview:
This project collects a user's first name, second name, age, and address. It checks if the user is old enough to proceed and stores the data in the dictionary. If they are under 18, the program ceases. 

Key Features:
- Age verification
- Storing user data in a dictionary
- Input validation
- Output using f-strings

Improvements I could do/use in other projects:
These are improvements that, with experience, I can implement and use for better user design.
- Error checking
- Functions
- Additional data stored, like postcode, etc
- Saving users to a file
